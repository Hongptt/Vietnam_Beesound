The new dataset is called add_BUZZ2. The information about the sources added and the detail of the new dataset is provided below. 
Firstly, we utilized the INMP441 I2S Omnidirectional Microphones as sound sensors to capture bee audio from the environment. 
The bee sounds were collected at two different beehives on different days in different weather conditions in June and July 2021. 
This was summer time in Vietnam, and it was quite hot: The outdoor temperature fluctuated from 34 to 39 degrees Celsius. 
But there were also some cool or rainy days in which the temperature ranged from 29 to 33 degrees Celsius. Our beehives were placed 
next to a construction site, and there was the noise like the vibration or the sound of machinery under construction. 
After collecting, the obtained signals were cut into 2-second samples with overlapping of 1/5s. Finally, we designed two schemes for add_BUZZ2 as follows:

Firstly, we picked up randomly 200 bee buzzing samples (train_200) and put them into the training set of BUZZ2, while the number of bee samples added to 
the testing set and the validation set is 4 (test_800) and 8 times higher, i.e., 800 samples and 1600 samples, respectively. 
This scheme corresponds to the case when there are very few new samples for training the ML models.
