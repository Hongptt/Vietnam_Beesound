The dataset add_BUZZ2 is extended from the BUZZ2 dataset introduced in “Kulyukin et al. Toward Audio Beehive Monitoring: Deep Learning vs. Standard Machine 
Learning in Classifying Beehive Audio Samples. Applied Sciences, 8(9):1573, September 2018”. The new bee buzzing sounds added to the dataset are recorded as follows. 
Firstly, the  INMP441 I2S Omnidirectional Microphones were set up inside the beehives to capture bee audio. The data were collected at two different beehives in 
different weather conditions in June and July 2021. This was the summertime in Vietnam, which was quite hot. The outdoor temperature fluctuated from 34 to 39 
degrees Celsius.  But there were also some cool or rainy days in which the temperature ranged from 29 to 33 degrees Celsius. Our beehives were placed next to a 
construction site, and there were noises like the vibration or the sound of machinery under construction. After collecting, the obtained signals were cut into 
2-second samples with overlapping of 1/5s. The added audio includes 2600 samples and is split into the training set, the testing set, and the validation set, 
depending on the users and situations. Finally, we designed two schemes for add_BUZZ2 as follows:

Firstly, we picked up randomly 200 bee buzzing samples (train_200) and put them into the training set of BUZZ2, while the number of bee samples added to 
the testing set and the validation set is 4 (test_800) and 8 times higher, i.e., 800 samples and 1600 samples, respectively. 
This scheme corresponds to the case when there are very few new samples for training the ML models.
